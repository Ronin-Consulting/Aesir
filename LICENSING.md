# AESIR™ Licensing Overview

AESIR™ is a source-available AI platform provided under a custom End User License Agreement (EULA) inspired by models like Unreal Engine. This licensing structure allows broad access for individuals, hobbyists, educators, and small-scale commercial users while requiring royalties for high-revenue products to support ongoing development. The full EULA is available at [ronin.consulting/eula](https://ronin.consulting/eula) (link to be updated with actual URL). By accessing or using AESIR™, you agree to the EULA terms.

**Important Notes**:
- AESIR™ is **source-available**, not open source (as defined by OSI). You can view, modify, and build upon the code, but with restrictions outlined below.
- Source code access is gated: Sign up at [ronin.consulting/signup](https://ronin.consulting/signup) (link to be updated), provide your GitHub username, and agree to the EULA to receive an invitation to the private GitHub repository.
- This model encourages community contributions (e.g., pull requests for enhancements like new Semantic Kernel plugins for edge optimizations) while ensuring sustainability.
- Consult legal counsel for your specific use case; this overview is not legal advice.

## Licensing Tiers

AESIR™ uses a dual-tier model based on the lifetime gross revenue of products or services incorporating AESIR™.

### Free Tier (No Royalties)
- **Eligibility**: Applies if the lifetime gross revenue (as defined below) from any product or service built on or incorporating AESIR™ does not exceed $2,000,000 USD.
- **Rights Granted**:
  - Full access to source code for viewing, modification, building, and internal use.
  - Deploy AESIR™ in personal, educational, non-commercial, or small-scale commercial projects (e.g., edge-deployed AI chat clients using Semantic Kernel v1.5.9+ for local Ollama models).
  - Distribute modified versions with attribution (e.g., "Powered by AESIR™ from Ronin Consulting") and share significant modifications publicly if redistributed.
- **Restrictions**:
  - No royalties required below the threshold.
  - Must comply with EULA terms, including no reverse-engineering beyond permitted modifications and adherence to export laws (relevant for military/edge use cases).
  - Prohibit enabling unlicensed use by others.
- **Examples**: A startup prototyping document intelligence tools on edge devices pays nothing until their product scales beyond $2M in attributable revenue.

### Royalty Tier (Commercial Use)
- **Trigger**: Activates if the lifetime gross revenue from a product or service incorporating AESIR™ exceeds $2,000,000 USD.
- **Royalty Structure**: Flat 3% on all gross revenue above the $2M exemption threshold.
  - Calculated quarterly and self-reported via a portal at [ronin.consulting/reporting](https://ronin.consulting/reporting).
  - Paid to Ronin Consulting; includes audit rights for verification.
- **Benefits**: All free tier rights, plus optional add-ons like priority support, custom integrations (e.g., enterprise authentication plugins for Semantic Kernel), or consulting for air-gapped deployments.
- **Examples**: For a defense intelligence platform generating \$5M in attributable revenue, royalties = 3% of (\$5M - \$2M) = $90,000.

| Aspect | Free Tier (≤ $2M Lifetime Revenue per Product) | Royalty Tier (> $2M Lifetime Revenue per Product) |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Access to Source Code** | Full (view, modify, build, redistribute with conditions) | Full, plus potential premium features/support |
| **Usage Rights** | Personal, educational, internal, or small commercial | Full commercial, with royalties on excess revenue |
| **Cost** | Free | 3% flat royalty on attributable gross revenue above $2M (quarterly) |
| **Support** | Community-driven (GitHub issues/PRs) | Priority support available (contact for details) |

## Definition of Gross Revenue
To ensure fairness, "gross revenue" is narrowly defined as revenue directly attributable to the specific product or service incorporating AESIR™:
- **Included**: Total monetary value received from sales, subscriptions, licensing, advertising, in-app purchases, or other monetization directly generated by the AESIR-integrated product/service, before deductions for costs, taxes, refunds, or discounts.
- **Excluded**:
  - Revenue from unrelated products/services not incorporating AESIR™.
  - Non-monetary considerations (e.g., barter, equity grants).
  - Pass-through fees (e.g., third-party payment processors).
- **Attribution**: If AESIR™ is part of a bundled product, only the pro-rated portion of revenue directly tied to AESIR™'s functionality counts (e.g., based on feature usage or fair allocation).
- **Reporting**: Users must maintain records (e.g., invoices) for attributable revenue and report accurately. No pro-rating required unless bundling applies—keep it simple for standalone uses.

## Accessing the Source Code
1. **Signup Process**: Visit [ronin.consulting/signup](https://ronin.consulting/signup), create an account, provide your GitHub username, and explicitly agree to the EULA.
2. **Invitation**: Upon verification, you'll receive an automated invitation to the private GitHub repository (RoninConsulting/AESIR).
3. **Once Invited**: Clone the repo, build with .NET Core, and start developing (e.g., customize Semantic Kernel orchestrations for your edge scenarios).
4. **Why Gated?**: Ensures all users are bound by the EULA and helps build a community database for updates and support.

## Contributions
We welcome improvements to AESIR™ (e.g., edge optimizations for low-bandwidth environments or new plugins for PostgreSQL/Qdrant integrations)!
- **Process**: Submit pull requests (PRs) to the main repo branch.
- **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: Required for all contributions—sign via our CLA bot during PR submission to grant Ronin Consulting rights to use your changes in both tiers.
- **Guidelines**: Follow standard GitHub workflows; focus on cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux via Avalonia) and edge performance (e.g., sub-500 token responses).

## FAQ
Here are answers to some anticipated questions about AESIR™ licensing. If your question isn't covered, contact info@ronin.consulting.

### What counts as a "product or service" for the revenue threshold?
A "product or service" refers to any standalone application, tool, or offering that incorporates AESIR™ (e.g., a custom edge AI chat client built with our Semantic Kernel integrations). If you have multiple distinct products, each is evaluated separately for the $2M threshold.

### How do I calculate and report royalties?
Use the formula: 3% of (lifetime attributable gross revenue - $2M). Report quarterly via the portal at ronin.consulting/reporting, including supporting records like invoices. We'll provide templates and examples upon signup.

### Can I use AESIR™ in open source projects?
Yes, as long as the project complies with the EULA and doesn't generate revenue exceeding $2M. If redistributed, include attribution and share modifications publicly. Note that AESIR™ itself is source-available, not OSI open source.

### What if my product bundles AESIR™ with other technologies?
Only the pro-rated portion of revenue directly attributable to AESIR™'s features counts (e.g., if AESIR™ powers 30% of the product's value based on usage, attribute 30% of revenue). Maintain records for fair allocation; contact us for guidance on complex bundles.

### How does this apply to internal tools or non-commercial use?
Internal or non-commercial uses (e.g., personal edge deployments for research) are always free, regardless of your organization's size, as no gross revenue is generated.

### What happens if I exceed the threshold mid-project?
Switch to the royalty tier upon exceeding $2M. Back royalties apply only to revenue above the threshold from that point forward—report promptly to avoid penalties.

### Is there support or exemptions for educational/non-profit users?
Educational and non-profit uses are free indefinitely, even if "revenue" (e.g., donations) exceeds $2M, as long as it's not commercial monetization. Contact us for custom exemptions or support.

### Can I modify AESIR™ and sell the modifications?
Yes, under the free tier if below $2M revenue. Above that, royalties apply to the attributable revenue from your modified version.

### How are contributions handled under this license?
Contributions via PRs require a CLA, granting us rights to integrate them. Your changes can be used in both tiers, but you retain ownership of your code.

### What if I need a custom license or enterprise features?
Email info@ronin.consulting for negotiated terms, such as flat fees instead of royalties or bespoke integrations (e.g., advanced Semantic Kernel plugins for edge-scale token management).
