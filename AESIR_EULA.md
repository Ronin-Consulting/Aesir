# AESIR™ End User License Agreement (EULA)

**Effective Date: July 26, 2025**

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you ("Licensee" or "you") and Ronin Consulting ("Licensor" or "we"), governing your access to and use of AESIR™ ("the Software"), a source-available AI platform for intelligent document processing, semantic search, and domain-specific AI assistance.

By accessing, downloading, installing, or using the Software (including its source code), you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree, do not access or use the Software.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a source-available license, not an open source license as defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Your rights are subject to the conditions below, including potential royalties for commercial use exceeding certain thresholds.

## 1. Definitions
- **Software**: AESIR™, including all source code, binaries, documentation, and related materials provided by Licensor.
- **Product**: Any application, tool, service, or offering created by you that incorporates, embeds, or relies on the Software or modifications thereof.
- **Gross Revenue**: Revenue directly attributable to a Product, meaning the total monetary value received from sales, subscriptions, licensing, advertising, in-app purchases, or other monetization generated by the Product, before deductions for costs, taxes, refunds, or discounts. Excludes:
  - Revenue from unrelated products/services not incorporating the Software.
  - Non-monetary considerations (e.g., barter, equity grants).
  - Pass-through fees (e.g., third-party payment processors).
  If the Software is part of a bundled Product, only the pro-rated portion directly tied to the Software's functionality counts (based on fair allocation, e.g., feature usage).
- **Exemption Threshold**: $2,000,000 USD in lifetime Gross Revenue per Product.
- **Modifications**: Any changes, enhancements, or derivatives you make to the Software.
- **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: A separate agreement required for submitting contributions to the Software's repository.

## 2. Grant of License
Subject to compliance with this EULA:
- Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access, view, modify, build, and use the Software for personal, educational, internal, or commercial purposes.
- You may distribute Products incorporating the Software, provided you include attribution (e.g., "Powered by AESIR™ from Ronin Consulting") and comply with royalty obligations if applicable.
- Access to source code is gated: You must sign up at ronin.consulting/signup, agree to this EULA, and receive an invitation to the private GitHub repository.

## 3. Free Tier (No Royalties)
- If a Product's lifetime Gross Revenue does not exceed the Exemption Threshold, your use is royalty-free.
- You may modify and redistribute the Software under this tier, but must share significant Modifications publicly if redistributed (e.g., via forks or PRs) and include attribution.

## 4. Royalty Tier
- If a Product's lifetime Gross Revenue exceeds the Exemption Threshold, you must pay royalties as follows:
  - Rate: Flat 3% on all Gross Revenue above the Exemption Threshold.
  - Calculation: Quarterly, based on cumulative lifetime Gross Revenue.
  - Reporting and Payment: Self-report via ronin.consulting/reporting, with payments due within 30 days of each quarter's end. Maintain records for audits (Licensor may audit with reasonable notice).
  - Example: For $5M Gross Revenue, royalties = 3% of ($5M - $2M) = $90,000.
- Back royalties apply to excess revenue from the date the threshold is exceeded.
- Benefits: Includes all free tier rights, plus eligibility for optional premium support, custom integrations, or consulting.

## 5. Restrictions
- You may not:
  - Use the Software in violation of applicable laws, including export controls (e.g., ITAR for military uses).
  - Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software beyond permitted Modifications.
  - Remove or alter any trademarks, copyrights, or attributions.
  - Enable unlicensed use by third parties.
  - Use the Software for harmful, illegal, or unethical purposes.
- All Modifications must comply with this EULA; significant ones must be shared if redistributed.

## 6. Contributions
- To contribute (e.g., via GitHub PRs), you must sign the CLA, granting Licensor perpetual, irrevocable rights to use, modify, and distribute your contributions in any tier.
- You retain ownership of your contributions but license them to Licensor.

## 7. Intellectual Property
- Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in the Software, including copyrights, trademarks (e.g., AESIR™), and patents.
- Your Modifications are owned by you, but subject to the license grants herein.

## 8. Warranties and Liability
- The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, express or implied (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement).
- Licensor is not liable for any damages, including indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the Software.
- You indemnify Licensor against claims arising from your use or Modifications.

## 9. Termination
- This EULA terminates if you breach any terms (e.g., non-payment of royalties).
- Upon termination, cease all use and delete the Software.
- Survival: Sections on royalties, IP, liability, and indemnity survive termination.

## 10. Governing Law
- Governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction, e.g., California, USA], without regard to conflicts of laws.
- Disputes resolved via arbitration in [Location].

## 11. Miscellaneous
- Entire Agreement: This EULA supersedes prior agreements.
- Amendments: Licensor may update this EULA; continued use constitutes acceptance.
- Severability: Invalid provisions do not affect the rest.
- Contact: info@ronin.consulting for questions.
