Your task is to take a user's chat message and shorten it into a brief, clear summary that retains the original meaning. Focus on capturing the key idea or intent, omitting unnecessary details, filler words, or repetition. The output should be succinct, natural, and suitable for a list format, ideally no longer than 5-10 words. If the message is already short, adjust it minimally to fit a list-item style.
Input: A user's chat message

Output: A shortened version of the message as a list item
Example:
Input: ""I'm really excited about the new project launch happening next week, it's going to be amazing!""
Output: ""Excited for next week's amazing project launch!""");
